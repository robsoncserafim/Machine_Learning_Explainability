## Description
This repository houses all the resources, notebooks, and insights gained from completing the "Machine Learning Explainability" course offered by Kaggle. The course is designed to empower data scientists and machine learning practitioners with the tools and techniques required to understand, interpret, and explain models. In the age of data-driven decision-making, the ability to explain model predictions is not just valuable but often mandatory in various industries when it requires the use of Machine Learning models to solve business problems.

The course goes beyond merely constructing predictive models; it delves into the intricacies of feature importance, permutation importance, partial dependence plots, and SHAP values, among others. These methods help in demystifying complex machine learning algorithms, offering actionable insights, and ensuring fair and transparent decision-making.

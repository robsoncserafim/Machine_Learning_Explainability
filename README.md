## Description
This repository holds all the resources, notebooks and insights gained from completing the "Machine Learning Explainability" course offered by Kaggle. The course is designed to empower data scientists and machine learning professionals with the tools and techniques needed to understand, interpret and explain models. In the age of data-driven decision making, the ability to explain model predictions is not only valuable, but often mandatory in several industries when it is necessary to use Machine Learning models to solve business problems.

The course goes beyond just building predictive models: it delves into the intricacies of the **importance of features, the importance of permutation, partial dependency graphs and SHAP values,** among others. 

These methods help demystify complex machine learning algorithms, opening up the "black box" of algorithms and providing actionable insights and ensuring fair and transparent decision-making.

## Topics Covered
- Feature Importance
- Permutation Feature Importance
- Partial Dependence Plots (PDP)
- SHAP Values
And more...

## Tools Used
- Python
